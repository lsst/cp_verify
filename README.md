Description
===========

The cp_verify package provides tasks to test the quality of calibration products.  These tasks can be run after calibration production to perform the tests defined in DMTN-101, and collate the results by exposure and for the full calibration run.  Calibrations that successfully pass all tests can then be certified without needing an extensive review.

In addition, these tasks can be used to generate metrics to monitor the stability of the camera over time by applying the same tests to newly taken raw calibration frames.
